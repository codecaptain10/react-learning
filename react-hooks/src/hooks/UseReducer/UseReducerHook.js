          An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action)
          = newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch
          method. <br />

          useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex
          state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state
          depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize
          performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can
          pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
